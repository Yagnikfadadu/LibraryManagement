## Features of application:
1) Students can effortlessly search for books using the mobile application. If a book is available, they can easily locate it in the library, accompanied by its availability status, rating, and a brief description.
2) By scanning the QR code embedded on the book's first page, students can check if they have sufficient book credits to issue a new book. Book credits denote the maximum number of books a student can borrow within a given timeframe. Upon scanning, a digital receipt is generated, which can be presented to the librarian for book issuance.
3) Students receive timely email notifications upon successful book issuance, including the expected return date. To ensure punctuality, I implemented a custom watcher that continuously monitors upcoming due dates.
4) Students can view their logs regarding books issued (returned/borrowed both) for better tracking and management of their reading habits.
5) In case a student fails to return the book within the stipulated time frame, they are temporarily barred from issuing new books and are subject to fines as per the established norms.
6) To further assist students in managing their borrowed books, automated email reminders are sent one day prior to the due date, prompting them for timely book returns.
7) When it's time to return a book, the librarian system sends an OTP to the student's registered email. This OTP is required to be entered into the librarian's system to complete the return process, consequently increasing the student's book credit quota.

## Further scope:
By analyzing the transactional data of issued books, we can gain insights into the reading preferences of students, identifying popular book genres and peak reading periods. By applying machine learning algorithms, we can then personalize book recommendations for students based on their historical borrowing patterns, fostering a more engaging and tailored reading experience. Additionally, students can book their reading space in the library from the mobile application to avoid overcrowding during exam days, thereby optimizing their study environment.
